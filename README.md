git clone https://github.com/meva/retiresmart-tax-efficient-withdrawal-strategist.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd retiresmart-tax-efficient-withdrawal-strategist

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### API Key Configuration

The application uses Google Gemini for optional AI insights. 
- You do **not** need an environment variable.
- Simply click the **Settings (Gear Icon)** in the top right of the application to enter your key locally.

3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new API key

## 🛠️ Development

### Run Locally

You can run the application in two modes:

**1. Web Mode (Browser)**
Runs as a standard web application in your default browser.
```bash
npm run dev -- --mode web
```

**2. Desktop Mode (Electron)**
Runs as a native desktop application window.
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` if running in web mode.

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

### Build for Production

```bash
# Create an optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview

### Deployment

#### Option 1: Static Web Hosting (AWS S3, GCS, Netlify, etc.)
You can generate a static distribution folder to host the web version anywhere.

```bash
# Generate the 'dist' folder
./prepare-dist.sh
```

This will create a `dist` folder containing:
- `index.html` (Entry point)
- `assets/` (Compiled JavaScript and CSS)

Upload the contents of this folder to your static file host.

## 🧱 Services Architecture

The business logic of FiscalSunset is decoupled from the UI layer into distinct service modules located in `src/services/`:

- **`calculationEngine.ts`**: The core "tax brain" of the application. It handles complex IRS rules including the "Two-Layer Cake" tax calculation, RMD requirements, Social Security taxation, and the "Fill Strategy" algorithm for optimal Roth Conversions.
- **`fireCalculations.ts`**: Specialized math for the early retirement community. Projects when users will achieve various FIRE milestones (Lean, Barista, Coast, Standard, Fat) based on real rate-of-return models.
- **`MonteCarloEngine.ts`**: Statistical engine evaluating portfolio viability. Runs 10,000-iteration probability simulations using Geometric Brownian Motion and historical asset correlations (VTI, VXUS, BND, BNDX).
- **`projection.ts`**: Handles deterministic asset accumulation projections prior to retirement, factoring in inflation, growth assumptions, and recurring contributions.
- **`geminiService.ts`**: AI integration layer. Constructs highly detailed, context-aware prompts encapsulating the user's entire financial state to securely query the Google Gemini API for fiduciary-style advice.
- **`db.ts`**: The local persistence layer. Implements Dexie.js to interface with the browser's IndexedDB, ensuring user profiles and API keys are stored securely on the device without any external database.

## 🧠 Calculation Methodology

FiscalSunset uses a deterministic projection model with high-fidelity tax calculations. Unlike simple calculators that use effective tax rates, this engine simulates the actual IRS Form 1040 logic for every year of the projection using 2026 estimates.

### 1. The Tax Engine ("Two-Layer Cake")
The application calculates federal taxes using the standard IRS method where **Ordinary Income** sits at the bottom and **Capital Gains/Dividends** sit on top.

*   **Ordinary Income:** Wages, Interest, Pension, Traditional IRA withdrawals, and Taxable Social Security.
*   **Capital Gains:** Qualified Dividends and Long-Term Capital Gains from brokerage sales.
*   **Deductions:**
    *   **Standard Deduction (2026):** ~$16,100 (Single) / $32,200 (Married).
    *   **Age 65+ Catch-up:** Adds ~$2,050 (Single) / $1,650 (Married).
    *   **OBBBA Senior Deduction:** Modeled 2025-2028 deduction of up to $12,000 for seniors, including phase-out logic ($1 reduction per $0.06 over thresholds).

### 2. Withdrawal Priority ("FiscalSunset Approach")
To minimize lifetime tax liability, the engine withdraws assets in a specific order to fill the spending gap:

1.  **Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs):** Mandatory withdrawals from Traditional IRAs starting at age 73 (using Uniform Lifetime Table).
2.  **Taxable Brokerage:** Sold first to take advantage of 0% Capital Gains brackets.
3.  **Roth IRA (Basis):** Contributions are withdrawn tax/penalty-free.
4.  **Traditional IRA:** Withdrawn up to top of low tax brackets or to fill standard deduction.
5.  **Roth IRA (Earnings):** Accessed last to maximize tax-free growth.
6.  **HSA:** Treated as long-term care/medical reserve (last resort).

*Early Retirement (FIRE) Logic:*
If the user is under 59.5, the engine automatically simulates:
*   **SEPP / 72(t) Payments:** Calculates substantially equal periodic payments to access Traditional IRA funds penalty-free.
*   **Rule of 55:** Simulates penalty-free access if applicable.
*   **Penalty Withdrawals:** Only triggers 10% penalty if no other liquidity sources exist.

### 3. Roth Conversion Optimizer ("Fill Strategy")
The "Strategy" tab runs an optimization loop to recommend Roth Conversions. It identifies "Headroom" in your current tax situation and recommends converting Traditional IRA funds to fill that space, up to the nearest "Cliff."

**Constraints Checked:**
*   **Tax Bracket:** Fills up to the top of the 10%, 12%, or 22% bracket.
*   **IRMAA Cliffs:** Prevents conversion from triggering higher Medicare Part B/D premiums (e.g., crossing $212k MAGI).
*   **Social Security "Torpedo":** Detects the effective marginal rate spike (up to 49.95%) caused by the taxation of Social Security benefits and advises restricting conversions in this zone.

### 4. Longevity Projection
The Longevity tab projects assets up to age 100.
*   **Inflation:** Spending needs are inflated annually by the `Inflation Rate` (default 2.5-3.0%).
*   **Growth:** Remaining assets grow by the `Rate of Return` (distinct rates for Accumulation vs. Retirement phases).
*   **Depletion Order:** For the longevity visualizer, assets are burned down sequentially: Brokerage → Traditional IRA → Roth IRA → HSA.
*   **Income Composition:** Tracks the shifting mix of fixed income (SS, Pension) vs. Portfolio Withdrawals over time to show how the "Paycheck" is constructed.

### 5. Monte Carlo Simulation
The optional Portfolio Modeler uses Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate 10,000 possible market paths for your customized portfolio.
*   **Asset Classes:** Uses historical return and volatility data for US Stock (VTI), Int'l Stock (VXUS), US Bond (BND), and Int'l Bond (BNDX).
*   **Correlations:** Implements a correlation matrix to account for how assets move in relation to one another (diversification benefit).
*   **Outputs:** Proves a statistical "range of outcomes" rather than a single static guess, helping you choose a more robust Annual Return assumption.
